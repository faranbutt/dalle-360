## Application Description

With the technological leap in generative AI, there are countless new businesses and startups which are using AI image generation in their pipeline. A non significant amount of these ventures can get supercharged with the ability to convert their 2D images to immersive environments and 3D objects A simple and intuitive tool to produce immersive 360Â° views using Dall-E 2 API as Proof of Concept Further iterations include integrating this with unity engine so the immersive environment can be manipulated and populated with 3D objects like in a video game. This use case has been verified by our first customers and by the industry leader StabilityAI.
